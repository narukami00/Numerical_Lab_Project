NEWTON'S DIVIDED DIFFERENCE INTERPOLATION METHOD
==============================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation is a numerical method used to approximate the value of a function for a given x, using a set of data points. A key advantage of this method is that it does not require the data points to be equally spaced, making it more versatile than Newton's Forward and Backward interpolation methods.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
Given a set of n+1 values (x0, y0), (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn).

The interpolation polynomial P(x) is given by:
P(x) = f[x0] + (x - x0)f[x0, x1] + (x - x0)(x - x1)f[x0, x1, x2] + ...

Where f[] denotes the divided difference:
- 0th order: f[xi] = yi
- 1st order: f[xi, xi+1] = (f[xi+1] - f[xi]) / (xi+1 - xi)
- 2nd order: f[xi, xi+1, xi+2] = (f[xi+1, xi+2] - f[xi, xi+1]) / (xi+2 - xi)

ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Input the number of data points n.
2. Input the x and y values. Note that x values do not need to be equally spaced.
3. Construct the Divided Difference Table:
   - Calculate 1st order differences for all adjacent pairs.
   - Calculate 2nd order differences using 1st order differences.
   - Continue until the n-th order difference is found.
4. Apply the interpolation formula.

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
- Construction of Difference Table: O(n^2)
- Evaluation of Formula: O(n)
- Overall: O(n^2)

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- Applicable to both equally and unequally spaced intervals.
- Truncation error can be calculated with an extra point.

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- More arithmetic operations involved in calculating the divided differences compared to simple forward/backward differences.
