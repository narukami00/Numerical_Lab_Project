NEWTON'S FORWARD INTERPOLATION METHOD
=====================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Newton's Forward Interpolation is a numerical method used to approximate the value of a function for a given x, using a set of equally spaced data points. It is particularly useful when the point of interpolation lies near the beginning of the data set.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
Given a set of n values (x0, y0), (x1, y1), ..., (xn-1, yn-1) where the x values are equally spaced with interval h.
u = (x - x0) / h

The forward interpolation formula is:
y(x) = y0 + u*Δy0 + (u(u-1)/2!)*Δ^2y0 + (u(u-1)(u-2)/3!)*Δ^3y0 + ...


ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Input the number of data points n.
2. Input the x and y values.
3. Construct the Forward Difference Table.
4. Calculate u = (x - x0)/h.
5. Apply Newton's Forward Interpolation formula to calculate the approximate value of y at x.

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
- Construction of Difference Table: O(n^2)
- Evaluation of Formula: O(n)
- Overall: O(n^2)

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- Efficient for calculating function values near the start of the table.
- Simple calculation once the difference table is built.

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- Requires x values to be equally spaced.
