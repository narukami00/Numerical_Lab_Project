OVERVIEW:
Transcendental Regression is a curve-fitting technique used when the relationship between the independent variable (x) and dependent variable (y) involves transcendental functions such as exponential, logarithmic, or power functions. These functions cannot be represented by simple polynomials.This regression method is widely used in scientific and engineering problems where growth, decay, or scaling behavior is observed.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
Transcendental regression is based on the Least Squares Method, similar to linear and polynomial regression.Many transcendental models are transformed into linear form using logarithmic transformations so that linear regression techniques can be applied.

Error for each data point:
ei = yi − ŷi

ALGORITHM STEPS:
1.Read number of data points (n)
2.Read n pairs of x and y values
3.Choose appropriate transcendental model (exponential, logarithmic, or power)
4.Apply logarithmic transformation to convert the model into linear form
5.Compute required summations for least squares
6.Solve for regression coefficients
7.Convert coefficients back to original model form
8.Display the final transcendental regression equation

CONVERGENCE:
Produces a unique solution if data satisfies model assumptions
Accuracy depends on correct model selection
Sensitive to noisy data after transformation

STOPPING CONDITION:
Single computation (non-iterative)
Terminates after coefficient estimation

ADVANTAGES:
Models exponential and logarithmic behavior effectively
Suitable for growth and decay phenomena
Simple implementation using transformations
Extends applicability beyond polynomial models

DISADVANTAGES:
Requires correct model assumption
Logarithmic transformation not possible for non-positive values
Sensitive to outliers
Limited to specific functional forms
