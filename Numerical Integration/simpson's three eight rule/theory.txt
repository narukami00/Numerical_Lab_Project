SIMPSON'S 3/8 RULE
==================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Simpson's 3/8 Rule is similar to Simpson's 1/3 Rule but is based on approximating the integrand with a third-order polynomial (cubic) passing through four consecutive points.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
To integrate a function f(x) over [a, b]:
- Divide the interval into 'n' equal subintervals.
- IMPORTANT: 'n' must be a multiple of 3.
- Step size h = (b - a)/n.

The approximation formula is:
Integral = (3h/8) * [(y0 + yn) + 3*(y1 + y2 + y4 + y5 + ...) + 2*(y3 + y6 + ...)]


ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Input Parameters:
   - Function coefficients (for polynomial)
   - Limits of integration: lower (a) and upper (b)
   - Number of intervals (n) [Must be a multiple of 3]

2. Initialization:
   - Calculate step size: h = (b - a)/n
   - Initialize sum = f(a) + f(b)

3. Accumulation Loop:
   - For i from 1 to n-1:
     - Calculate x = a + i*h
     - If i is divisible by 3: Add 2*f(x) to sum
     - Else: Add 3*f(x) to sum

4. Final Calculation:
   - Result = (3*h/8)*sum

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
O(n) where n is the number of subintervals.

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- Generally more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule.
- Gives exact results for polynomials of degree 3 or less.
- Can be used when the number of subintervals is a multiple of 3.

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- The number of subintervals 'n' must be a multiple of 3.
- Slightly more complex computation than the 1/3 rule.
