SIMPSON'S 1/3 RULE
==================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Simpson's 1/3 Rule is a numerical method for approximating definite integrals. It works  by approximating the integrand with a second-order polynomial passing through three consecutive points.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
To integrate a function f(x) over [a, b]:
- Divide the interval into 'n' equal subintervals (n must be even).
- Step size h = (b - a)/n.

The approximation formula is:
Integral = (h/3) * [ (y0 + yn) + 4*(y1 + y3 + ...) + 2*(y2 + y4 + ...)]


ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Input Parameters:
   - Function coefficients (for polynomial)
   - Limits of integration: lower (a) and upper (b)
   - Number of intervals (n) [Must be even]

2. Initialization:
   - Calculate step size: h = (b - a)/n
   - Initialize sum = f(a) + f(b)

3. Accumulation Loop:
   - For i from 1 to n-1:
     - Calculate x = a + i*h
     - If i is even: Add 2*f(x) to sum
     - If i is odd:  Add 4*f(x) to sum

4. Final Calculation:
   - Result = (h/3)*sum

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
O(n) where n is the number of subintervals.

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- More accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule for the same number of intervals.
- Gives exact results for polynomials of degree 3 or less.

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- The number of subintervals 'n' must be even.
