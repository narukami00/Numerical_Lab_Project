Test Case 1:
f(x) = x^3-2.00x^2-4.00x+5.00
Root found at x = -1.79129 between [-1.8, -1.7] | Interval width below relative tolerance
Root found at x = 1 | function value close enough to 0
Root found at x = 2.79129 between [2.7, 2.8] | Interval width below relative tolerance

Test Case 2:
f(x) = x^2-5.00x+6.00
Root found at x = 2 | function value close enough to 0
Root found at x = 3 | function value close enough to 0

Test Case 3:
f(x) = x^4-5.00x^2+4.00
Root found at x = -2 | function value close enough to 0
Root found at x = -1 | function value close enough to 0
Root found at x = 1 | function value close enough to 0
Root found at x = 2 | function value close enough to 0
