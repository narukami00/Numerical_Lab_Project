NEWTON-RAPHSON METHOD
=====================

OVERVIEW:
---------
The Newton-Raphson Method is an iterative numerical technique for finding roots of a real-valued function. It uses the tangent line at the current approximation to find a better approximation. It is one of the fastest converging root-finding methods when properly initialized.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
Using Taylor series expansion of f(x) around point x₀:
f(x) ≈ f(x₀) + f'(x₀)(x - x₀)

Setting f(x) = 0 and solving for x:
x = x₀ - f(x₀) / f'(x₀)

ITERATION FORMULA:
------------------
x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

Where:
- x_n is the current approximation
- f(x_n) is the function value at x_n
- f'(x_n) is the derivative at x_n
- x_{n+1} is the next approximation

ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Start with initial guess x₀
2. Compute f(x_n) and f'(x_n)
3. Calculate next approximation: x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)
4. Check stopping criteria
5. If not converged, set x_n = x_{n+1} and repeat from step 2

CONVERGENCE:
------------
- Quadratic convergence near the root
- Number of correct digits approximately doubles each iteration
- Convergence condition: |f'(x)| should not be too small
- Requires good initial guess

Convergence Rate:
|e_{n+1}| ≈ C|e_n|²

Where e_n is the error at iteration n

STOPPING CRITERIA:
------------------
1. |f(x_n)| < tolerance
2. |x_{n+1} - x_n| < tolerance
3. |x_{n+1} - x_n| / |x_n| < relative tolerance
4. Maximum iterations reached

DERIVATIVE CALCULATION:
-----------------------
Analytical: f'(x) computed symbolically
Numerical: f'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h (finite difference)

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
O(n) iterations, typically 4-6 iterations for good convergence

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- Fastest convergence (quadratic) among simple methods
- Requires few iterations
- Highly efficient near the root
- Can be extended to systems of equations
- Widely applicable

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- Requires derivative calculation
- May fail if f'(x) = 0 or very small
- Sensitive to initial guess
- May diverge or oscillate
- Cannot guarantee convergence
- May overshoot and diverge for poor initial guess

FAILURE CASES:
--------------
1. f'(x_n) = 0: Division by zero
2. Stationary points: Method gets stuck
3. Local extrema: May jump to wrong region
4. Oscillation: Between two points
5. Divergence: Moving away from root

INITIAL GUESS SELECTION:
------------------------
- Plot the function to identify approximate location
- Use bisection for few iterations first
- Domain knowledge of the problem
- Multiple starting points for comparison
