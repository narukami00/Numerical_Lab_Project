OVERVIEW:
The Runge–Kutta (RK) Method is a numerical technique used to obtain approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with given initial conditions. It is widely used because it provides high accuracy without requiring higher-order derivatives.The RK method improves upon Euler’s method by using weighted averages of slopes at different points within each step.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
The exact solution of a differential equation is often difficult or impossible to find analytically. The Runge–Kutta method approximates the solution by expanding the Taylor series and carefully selecting intermediate slopes to achieve higher accuracy.

FOURTH-ORDER RUNGE–KUTTA FORMULA:
Let step size = h
k₁ = h f(xₙ, yₙ)
k₂ = h f(xₙ + h/2, yₙ + k₁/2)
k₃ = h f(xₙ + h/2, yₙ + k₂/2)
k₄ = h f(xₙ + h, yₙ + k₃)

Next value:
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + (1/6)(k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)

ALGORITHM STEPS:
1.Initial values x₀, y₀
2.Step size h
3.Final value of x
4.Set x = x₀, y = y₀
5.Compute k₁, k₂, k₃, k₄ using RK formulas
6.Update y using weighted average
7.Update x = x + h
8.Continue until desired x is reached
9.Display approximate solution at each step or final value
