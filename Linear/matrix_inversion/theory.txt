MATRIX INVERSION METHOD
=======================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Matrix inversion finds the inverse of a square matrix A, denoted as A^(-1), such that A * A^(-1) = I, where I is the identity matrix. For solving Ax = b, if A^(-1) exists, then x = A^(-1) * b.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
For an n×n matrix A, the inverse A^(-1) exists if and only if:
- det(A) ≠ 0 (A is non-singular)
- A is a square matrix
- A has full rank

Property: A * A^(-1) = A^(-1) * A = I

GAUSS-JORDAN METHOD FOR INVERSION:
-----------------------------------
The most common method uses Gauss-Jordan elimination on [A|I]:

1. Form augmented matrix [A|I] where I is the identity matrix
2. Apply row operations to transform A to I
3. The result is [I|A^(-1)]

Algorithm Steps:
For each column k from 1 to n:
  a. Make diagonal element 1 (divide row k by a[k][k])
  b. Eliminate all other elements in column k
  c. Apply same operations to the right side (identity part)

COFACTOR METHOD:
----------------
Alternative approach:
A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)

Where:
- adj(A) is the adjugate (transpose of cofactor matrix)
- Cofactor C[i][j] = (-1)^(i+j) * M[i][j]
- M[i][j] is the minor (determinant of submatrix)

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After finding A^(-1):
- Multiply A * A^(-1)
- Result should be identity matrix I
- Check if diagonal elements = 1, off-diagonal = 0

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
- Gauss-Jordan method: O(n^3)
- Cofactor method: O(n^4) - less efficient

NUMERICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------
- Avoid division by very small numbers
- Use partial pivoting for stability
- Check condition number of matrix
- Ill-conditioned matrices have unstable inverses

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- Direct method for solving Ax = b
- Useful when solving multiple systems
- Gives complete inverse matrix

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- Computationally expensive (O(n^3))
- Numerically unstable for ill-conditioned matrices
- Not recommended for sparse matrices
- Unnecessary for solving single linear system

SPECIAL CASES:
--------------
1. Diagonal Matrix: Inverse has reciprocals on diagonal
2. Orthogonal Matrix: A^(-1) = A^T
3. Symmetric Matrix: Inverse is also symmetric
4. Singular Matrix: No inverse exists

CONDITION NUMBER:
-----------------
Measures sensitivity to errors:
cond(A) = ||A|| * ||A^(-1)||

- cond(A) ≈ 1: Well-conditioned (stable)
- cond(A) >> 1: Ill-conditioned (unstable)
