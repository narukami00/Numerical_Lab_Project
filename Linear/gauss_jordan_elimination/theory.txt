GAUSS-JORDAN ELIMINATION METHOD
================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Gauss-Jordan Elimination is an extension of Gauss Elimination that transforms the coefficient matrix into a diagonal form (reduced row echelon form). Unlike Gauss Elimination, it eliminates both above and below the pivot element, eliminating the need for back substitution.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
For a system Ax = b, the method transforms the augmented matrix [A|b] into the form [I|x], where I is the identity matrix and x is the solution vector.

ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Forward Elimination (Similar to Gauss):
   - Transform matrix to upper triangular form
   - For each pivot position (k,k):
     - Make the pivot element 1 by dividing the entire row
     - Eliminate all elements below the pivot

2. Backward Elimination:
   - Starting from the last row, moving upward:
   - Eliminate all elements above each pivot
   - Result: Diagonal matrix with 1's on diagonal

3. Solution:
   - Solution is directly available in the augmented column
   - No back substitution needed

PIVOT NORMALIZATION:
--------------------
For each pivot row k:
- Divide entire row by a[k][k]
- This makes the diagonal element equal to 1

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
O(n^3) - slightly more operations than Gauss Elimination due to backward elimination

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- No back substitution required
- Solution obtained directly
- Can compute matrix inverse simultaneously
- Better for finding matrix inverse

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- More computational steps than Gauss Elimination
- Still susceptible to round-off errors
- Requires non-zero pivot elements
