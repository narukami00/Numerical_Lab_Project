NEWTON'S FORWARD DIFFERENCE FORMULA FOR DIFFERENTIATION
=======================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Newton's Forward Difference Formula is used to approximate the derivative of a function given a set of tabulated data points. It is particularly useful when the point of interest is near the beginning of the dataset and the intervals between x values are equal.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
Given a set of values (x0, y0), (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn) where x values are equally spaced with step size h.
Let x be the point where the derivative is to be found.
let u = (x-x0)/h.


First Derivative f'(x):
f'(x) = (1/h) * [Δy0 + ((2u-1)/2)*Δ²y0 + ((3u²-6u+2)/6)*Δ³y0 + ...]

Second Derivative f''(x):
f''(x) = (1/h²) * [Δ²y0 + (u-1)*Δ³y0 + ...]

ALGORITHM STEPS:
----------------
1. Input Parameters:
   - Number of data points (n)
   - Arrays of x and y values
   - Target value x where derivative is required

2. Generate Forward Difference Table.

3. Calculation:
   - Calculate step size h = x[1] - x[0]
   - Calculate u = (x - x[0]) / h
   - Apply the derived formulas for f'(x) and f''(x) using the first row of the difference table.

4. Output:
   - Display the difference table.
   - Display the calculated first and second derivatives.

TIME COMPLEXITY:
----------------
O(n^2) to construct the difference table.
O(n) to calculate the derivative value.

ADVANTAGES:
-----------
- Simple to implement for equally spaced data.
- Accurate for points near the beginning of the table.

DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
- Requires equally spaced intervals.
- Accuracy decreases as the point moves away from the beginning of the table.
